This one time, I forgot to hit "start" at the beginning of a ride on Strava.

I memorized my ride path as I've ridden Klondike Bluffs near Moab UT many times.

I pulled historical rides from Strava in GPX format and combined with GPX data (garmin) from utahmountainbiking.com.

Used a GPX rendering tool to dial in segments: https://www.gpxeditor.co.uk/map

Then stitched the XML back together painstakingly to recover about 500ft of missing vert for Strava to track...
